# **Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom**  

## **Project Overview**   
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry, where churn refers to customers discontinuing their service. Accurate churn prediction helps companies identify at-risk customers early, allowing them to implement effective retention strategies. This not only enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty but also secures revenue streams in a highly competitive market.

## **Key Objectives**  
Predictive Modeling: Build a robust model to predict customer churn.
Data Monitoring: Highlight the importance of continuous data monitoring and model tuning to adapt to new patterns or changes in customer behavior.
Retention Strategies: Develop insights that can inform targeted customer retention strategies.  

## **Data Description:**   
The dataset contains information from a telecom company, featuring various customer-related details such as demographic information, account specifics, and service usage. Key attributes include:

Customer demographics (age, gender)  
Service usage (call minutes, data usage)  
Account details (plan type, monthly charges, contract duration)  

## **Installation**   
To run the notebook, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using the following commands:  

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit_learn
pip install xgboost
pip install deepchecks
pip install sweetviz  


## **Methodology**  
The project follows these steps:  

Data Exploration: Visualizing distributions and relationships to understand factors influencing churn.  
Preprocessing: Cleaning data and transforming features to prepare for modeling.  
Model Building: Using XGBoost for prediction due to its effectiveness with imbalanced datasets.  
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Insights and Actions: Drawing conclusions from the modelâ€™s results to recommend actions for customer retention.  


## **Key Findings**  
Early identification of churn indicators allows for timely interventions.  
Features like contract duration and monthly charges are critical predictors of churn.  
Continuous model evaluation and adaptation are crucial as customer behavior evolves.
